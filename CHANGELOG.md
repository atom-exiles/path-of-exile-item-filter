## Unreleased Version
* Began transpiling the package source code on first run, rather than packaging the compiled source.
* Use an activation trigger for package activation, instead of always activating.

## Version 1.1.5-1.1.8
* Full support for the additional sounds in Fall of Oriath.
* Mark "PlayAlertSound Orb" as invalid syntax.
* Improved package activation time.
* Moved the Git repository over to an organization.
* Removed the chunkSize configuration variable, as it is no longer used.
* Allow the UTF8 BOM to appear on the same line as Show and Hide blocks in the grammar.
* Stopped offloading work onto a separate Node process.
  * The 'text-buffer' optimizations in Atom 1.19 have made filter processing drastically faster on the main process, so this is no longer necessary.

The PlayAlertSound parser within Path of Exile now allows many different values to appear as the identifier, with some resulting in crashes whenever the sound is triggered. Our parser is strict and will mark these as errors.

## Versions 1.1.3-1.1.4
* Added full support for Fall of Oriath and the Harbinger league.
* Added support for the new PlayAlertSoundPositional rule.
* Added the new sounds for the PlayAlertSound rule.

## Version 1.1.0

* Started using a background process to do the initial parse of a filter. Loading large item filters will no longer freeze the editor for several seconds on file open.

  * General -> Chunk Size: allows you to control the maximum number of lines processed at any given time.
  * General -> Enable Editor Gutter: sets the visibility of our gutter in the editor.
  * Data -> Dataset: allows the selection of a dataset.
  * Linter -> Enable Warnings: toggles the display of Linter warning messages.
